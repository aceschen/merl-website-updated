    "copyEditedBlurb": "As the concluding film of the Star Wars sequel trilogy, <i>Rise of Skywalker</i> had big shoes to fill. And yet, the last film ended the saga with a fumble, with major characters being pushed to the sideline and an abundance of confusing narrative choices (I think we all remember the infamous <spoiler>‚ÄúSomehow, Palpatine has returned‚Äù</spoiler>). \n\nMany criticisms of the film are about it undoing the work of <i>The Last Jedi</i>, not only in tone but also in content. Kelly Marie Tran joined the franchise as Rose Tico, a mechanic for the resistance who joins Finn as they sabotage the First Order. Critical reception of Tran‚Äôs character was largely positive, and as a reporter at <a href=‚Äùhttps://www.bizjournals.com/losangeles/news/2017/12/14/flick-picks-the-last-jedi-ruled-by-dynamite.html‚Äù>L.A. Biz</a> writes, \"Tran is a welcome addition both culturally and narratively,  bringing much-appreciated representation to the cinematic universe.\" And yet, she all but disappears in <i>Rise of Skywalker</i>, relegated to the sidelines immediately after making her debut in the previous film. Tran was the subject of vicious racist and sexist attacks online during promotion for <i>The Last Jedi</i>, so her exclusion from <i>Skywalker</i> felt like a disappointing pander to that part of the audience. \n\nInstead of supporting their leads of color in the narrative, Disney shifted focus away from their storylines. John Boyega, who played Finn, faced similar harassment when he joined the franchise and his character‚Äôs arc was also limited in the last film.\n\nFinn had multiple romantic interests in the course of the trilogy (Rey, Rose, and the fandom‚Äôs favorite, Poe) and yet, these relationships never got any traction. At the expense of Finn‚Äôs involvement, we saw Kylo take more and more of a protagonist role as the <i>Rise of Skywalker</i> centered on his moral turning point and relationship with Rey. ‚Äú<a hfref=\"https://twitter.com/JohnBoyega/status/1212090062147637251?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">Star Wars romance üòóüëÄüôÇ,\"</a> Boyega wrote in a tweet from 2019, alluding to this narrative shift and showing pictures of Rey and Kylo torturing and stabbing each other.\n\nFinn‚Äôs romantic options weren‚Äôt the only threads that were dropped as the series progressed, like the force-sensitivity teases that were just abandoned (including the Very Important thing he had to tell Rey that they just‚Ä¶ never addressed). Director J.J. Abrams has since confirmed Finn was going to tell Rey about his connection with the force. But that never made it into the movie, and director notes shouldn‚Äôt be received as a replacement for actual content.\n\nPoe Dameron underwent his own problematic character changes in <i>Skywalker</i>, revealing his background as a spice smuggler. This included the introduction of an old love interest, who some perceived as a tool to disaffirm the fandom‚Äôs engagement with the popular Finn and Poe ship (known as the ‚ÄúStormpilot‚Äù ship). Star Wars loves its roguish-scoundrel-hero, but what we knew of Poe didn‚Äôt fit that image: he was an idealistic poster boy for the Resistance, and our re-introduction to the rebellion in <i>The Force Awakens</i>. Suddenly giving him a past in drug smuggling played into harmful stereotypes around Latinx men, who are disproportionately characterized in media as being involved with drugs and crime."

    "biasTagNotes": "S: Poe Dameron is given a new backstory in the film of being a former drug-runner. This plays into harmful stereotypes of latinx characters - and is a completely unnecessary addition to his character that is not explored in any meaningful way.\nFinn continues to be relegated to the role of \"supportive best friend\" that adds to problematic, stereotypical tropes like the \"black best friend\" who is never given a fleshed-out story-arc, despite being set-up as a main character in the first film.\nRey is forced to fix and redeem the genocidal antagonist of the entire franchise through her gentle acceptance of him and is saved by his love, which plays into harmful messaging about relationship dynamics for women as well as playing into the damsel-in-distress stereotype within her own movie.\nT: A majority of the characters of color are either completely minor or supporting characters who are not given fully fleshed out story arcs in comparison to their white counterparts.\nFinn is yet again given very little to do in the story despite being set-up as a major character in the beginning of the franchise. Poe is also given a smaller role and his character arc is given very little attention. \nRey is also somewhat tokenized. As a female jedi, her arc feels confused and contradictory to her previous films. Rey is also made to be a \"strong female\" archetype who is also used to redeem and love her abuser/the antagonist of the film, who she is forced to share her leading role with.\nC*: Finn and other characters like Jannah are given reduced roles and very little time in the narrative for their narrative arcs. As well, in Finn's case, there are arcs that seemed to be set up in previous films are completely dropped and ignored in this film (i.e: Jedi Finn, Finn as a Stormtrooper rebellion leader, etc.)",

This backstory has no basis in the previous films and seems to exist only to give something for the other characters to belittle Poe about. \nFinn is given a reduced role and is relegated to the supportive \"black best friend\" trope to the white protagonist - despite starting the triology off as, arguably, the deuteragonist. He is given nothing to do and is not allowed any agency throughout the film, often deferring or being overshadowed by white characters (ie: Hux saving Finn from being captured.) \n\n[eth10] Finn has less screen-time in this film than TFA, though he has gained some back from TLJ. However, he is given no expansive story-arc and he is mainly there to support Rey and be paired off with Poe. \n[eth10]: Most of the other characters of color are given an equally reduced role and investment - acting only to support the mechanisms of the plot and the white protagonists. \n[eth14]: Finn is given less screen-time and his arcs are completely abandoned or handled with very little care. His arc that seemed to be established in TFA of being force sensitive and a jedi is abandoned an dis only vaguely alluded to in the film. He is not given any significant time in the narrative to explore the arc of his freedom from the enslavement of the stormtroopers - nor is the arc of the defecting stormtrooper rebellion given any significant time for Finn to lead. \n[eth14]: Rose Tico is given a significantly reduced role in this film - and this follows severely racist vitriol from fans after TLJ.\n[gen06], [gen10]: Rey ends up sharing a major portion of her final, big confrontation with Palpatine with Kylo Ren, the villain who is quickly redeemed in the back-half of the film. She is also saved by him, removing a significant amount of agency from Rey's fight and control of her narrative. She then kisses him - despite the fact that he abused, tortured, gaslit, and demeaned her for the entire trilogy.  Fans were confused and disappointed with this portrayal as a \"romance\". Rey is forced to have a love interest and redeem the villain. She is also folded into a legacies of Star Wars - taking away a significant aspect of her character journey of being an unknown person with the ability to fight and use the force - reducing Rey's individuality to become more like the male characters that came before her.\n[gen10] Zorii Bliss exists mainly to be a former, quippy love-interest to Poe with little backstory of her own outside of him.\n[gen22] Rose Tico is given a significantly reduced role, despite being a major supporting character in TLJ.\n[sex06] There is a queer kiss in one shot with unnamed characters.

The film, for all intents and purposes, should have been a smashing conclusion to a beloved franchise; however, it ran into major problems with diversity and representation. The film attempts to provide interesting and diverse representation ‚Äì but its handling of several aspects caused significant negative reaction from fans and critics alike. Rey is one the first main female character of a Star Wars project ‚Äì and is the first female Jedi in the Star Wars films. Fans were glad to see that she was given a defined role where she was allowed to have an emotional arc, however, they felt that her role was diminished in favor of the male antagonist, Kylo Ren. A majority of Rey‚Äôs role in the film is relegated to supporting and furthering Kylo Ren‚Äôs character. Fans were split, with a significant reaction being negative, to the fact that Rey <spoilers> is brought back from the dead by Kylo Ren ‚Äì and rewards him for it with a kiss, despite the fact that he has spent the entire trilogy torturing, killing, and hunting Rey and her friends. </spoilers> The wasted potential fans mourned is not only for Rey, however. <i>Skywalker</i> also let down the character of Finn, the only main Black character in the trilogy. Finn also began with one of the most compelling story arcs: a former Stormtrooper who escaped his imprisonment with the First Order and joined the Resistance to fight. Finn was also implied on multiple occasions to be force-sensitive and a potential Jedi (Chekov‚Äôs lightsaber fight against Kylo Ren in <i>The Force Awakens</i>). Despite the incredible representation the trilogy began with, fans and critics alike were disappointed to see Finn‚Äôs role utterly reduced in the final installment. Finn was reduced to being a ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù trope support to Rey ‚Äì and was stripped of his agency in the story. Finn was often in need of rescue, and often seemed to function only as the plot needed him ‚Äì to be in the way, to have a joke, to get knocked around, to fight with Poe. The complete lack of fulfillment for Finn‚Äôs character is hugely disappointing and falls flat. <i>The Rise of Skywalker</i> contains many individual aspects of representation and potential that fans enjoyed and can hold on to, but on a holistic level, the film could not stick the landing on providing significant, meaningful representation and diversity. \n"
