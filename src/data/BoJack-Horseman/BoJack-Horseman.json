    "copyEditedBlurb": "There's actually not a lot to say about the character BoJack Horseman, the titular horse-man of the show <i>BoJack Horseman</i>, in terms of representation. Well, at least not yet. If you've seen or heard anything about the show, it shouldn't surprise you that before anything else we need to talk about Diane.\n\nDiane Nguyen, a Vietnamese-American (human) woman who first serves as BoJack's ghostwriter and then pursues an independent writing career, is one of the show’s five main characters, and the only character of color of the group. So it's unfortunate that she is voiced by Alison Brie, a white actress. <i>BoJack</i> is not the first animated show to have white actors voice characters of color: <i>Big Mouth</i>, <i>South Park</i>, and <i>The Simpsons</i> are among others who have recast actors to fit the character's ethnicity. Brie was not recast, but that wasn't the only issue. Creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg has said that while there were people of color in the writing room, there were never Southeast Asian writers, much less Vietnamese writers. He has gone on to admit that these decisions impacted the character from a narrative perspective. Because the show had cast a white woman to voice Diane, they strayed from writing about her experience as a Vietnamese or Asian woman. In an <a href=\"https://slate.com/culture/2018/09/bojack-horseman-raphael-bob-waksberg-diane-nguyen-representation.html\">interview with Slate in 2018</a>, Bob-Waksberg explains, \"We really downplayed her race and her cultural heritage. We’ve treated her basically like a white woman.\" The casting decision happened in S1, but the lack of diversity on both sides of the 'camera' had repercussions that have affected Diane throughout the whole show. \n\nIt's also worth noting that the only reason this season is tagged with *any* cast members of color is the introduction of \"Guy\" in Season 6 as a supporting character. Todd Chavez, voiced by Aaron Paul, <spoilers>was assumed to be Latinx for most of the show because of his last name, but it is revealed in S6 that he is white and his name comes from his stepdad who is Latino</spoilers>.\n\nOn the topic of Todd, there are many seasons-long arcs that <i>BoJack</i> handles really well regarding representation. I feel very comfortable calling Todd Chavez one of the most recognizable and mainstream representations of asexuality in current media. Todd first came out at the end of S3 in 2016 and being asexual has continued to tie into his character and narrative development all the way through the end of the show. While Aaron Paul isn't asexual, Todd wasn't initially written to be asexual and another character introduced in S6 *is* voiced by an asexual actress. Todd being seen as asexual by the writers could have come from harmful stereotypes about what asexual people are like, namely relating to his childish and somewhat naïve character. But this is mitigated by the fact that we see a diverse group of asexual characters throughout the show. As Todd learns more about asexuality the audience learns with him, including clarifying misconceptions around romantic attraction, relationships, and marriage. Asexual characters in media are... uncommon. At the time of writing, Todd is the first and only asexual character to be tagged by MERL. So I was pleasantly surprised that this part of his character is still integrated into the story three seasons later. "

I thought the show would follow similar tropes of Family Guy and American Dad, emphasizing the stereotypical white, straight family. However, the show was much more diverse. The cast unfortunately still included many animals played by white characters and white-washed characters. For instance, the Vietnamese character Diane Nguyen is incredibly whitewashed and her Vietnamese identity is never mentioned. This is done rightfully so as a white actress voices the character, however, this does not erase the fact that the character is still Vietnamese. Misrepresentation is not real representation. However, the series does well in interweaving the white and nonwhite communities. Diane Nguyen is in a relationship with a dark-skinned animal named Guy and Jorge Chavez, a Mexican American, and his step-son - Todd Charvez, a white American - work together to",

In regards to playing the asexual character Todd, Paul has stated \"I was so proud to represent that community.\" It is ambiguous whether or not he is actually asexual. Thus the character of Todd could be queer impersonation. I will note that the character of Todd is very well loved in asexual circles regardless of this possible fact.  \n[C*]= While the buffalo character of Guy is voiced by the black actor Lakeith Lee Stanfield and the actual buffalo has darker skin, there are no dark-skinned human actors. Guy's son the buffalo Sonny is also voiced by the white actor Will Arnett. Thus it is debatable wether or not Guy and Sonny are good representation for persons of color, let alone darker-skinned actors. In this part of season 6, Guy is not really the focus. He acts as a supportive character to Diane and we see their relationship blossom, but Guy is not explored out of the context of Diane (who is a Vietnamese-American character voiced by a white woman.

Specially, Diane experiences weight gain which is normalized, which goes against the stereotype that Asian Women are petite. Diane also challenges the stereotype of Asian Women being submissive when she sets boundaries and speaks up for herself in regards to other characters like BoJack. Diane, who is Vietnamese American, has a relationship with Guy who is a black-coded character voiced by a Black actor. Through the character of Guy, who is played by a black actor and can be considered black coded though he is a Bison, we get to see a devoted black father raising his son Sonny and co-parenting in a healthy way which challenges stereotypes about black men being neglectful fathers. We also get to see Guy in an interracial relationship with Diane and see their collaboration and there is no expressed friction due to their differing races (human/Vietnamese-American and Bison/Black-coded, which is refreshing as frequently mixed race relationships are represented as tumultuous and almost \"going against the grain\" in media. \n[eth15] interracial / poc/ mixed-race relationships normalized: Diane, who is Vietnamese American, has a relationship with Guy who is a black-coded character voiced by a Black actor.

For example, the character of Princess Carolyn who is a workaholic learns to prioritize other aspects of her life including her baby Ruthie and she even gets married. BoJack Horseman learns to focus outwards and be less selfish, and he attempts to atone for what he has done instead of being so individualistic like any stereotypical American star. \n[nat07] production team shares national culture for story centered on national cultural experiences: This show has a production team in America for this story which centers somewhat on American celebrity culture/media production and the mental health crisis we currently have in the USA.  \n[gen01] actor shares gender identity with character= All actors tagged shared their gender identity with their character. \n[gen05] challenges stereotypes and tropes about women= This season of BoJack horseman focuses on a variety of female characters with diverse goals and personalities. We see the strong career woman portrayed in Princess Carolyn, but we also get to see her embracing motherhood and learning to let go of her toxic relationship with BoJack. She also has a relationship with her male personal secretary and they get married, which goes against the typical office romance trope of the female character dating her boss. We get to see Diane who is a writer struggling to create and imbue her experiences into a novel and wanting to express her past traumas. She ends up embracing what feels natural, a quirky fun young adult novel about a young Vietnamese-American girl who is a detective solving mysteries at the mall. There is a meaningful conversation between Princess Carolyn and Diane about whether trauma can be good or bad and the worth in simply writing something that would benefit young women. This touches on the abuse women face within their families and shows in a nuanced manner how women cope with these traumas, such as Diane taking medication. We get to see the young college student Hollyhock struggle to grapple with the truth about her half brother, BoJack, who groomed a young girl Penny. Hollyhock was ostracized from the Sugarman family and adopted out as a baby and was so excited to find her birth family and was building a relationship with BoJack. We see this young woman slowly distance herself and go no contact with BoJack (not letting him push her boundaries when she is clearly uncomfortable). We get to see Penny and her mother Charlotte still grappling with the trauma left behind by BoJack and still pushing through to live their lives (we also get to see Penny and Charlotte discuss going public with the news but they ultimately stay quiet, reflecting the reality behind many women who experience grooming). We also get to see a female news reporter Paige who is dead set on finding out the truth behind a young famous female starlet's death, Sarah Lynn (To the point where Paige keeps delaying her wedding and is even running around in her wedding dress sleuthing).\n[gen09] nuanced portrayal of women's experience= Read [gen05]. Additionally, one great point that illustrated the nuanced portrayal of women's experiences is the reaction of both Princess Carolyn and Diane to hearing about BoJack's contribution to the grooming of Penny and the death of Sarah Lynn. Princess Carolyn wants to cover it up and she argues that technically what BoJack did was not wrong and that he could get out of it, going into manager mode. Diane immediately is disgusted and says BoJack should come clean as the reporters are already hot on his tail and that it is the right thing to do. Yet, ultimately both women are disgusted by BoJack's actions and after this point they begin distancing themselves from him. This shows the many ways in which women could be compelled to act when they are told about a male friend's harming of women. \n[gen21] increased visibility / investment in story of women compared to past seasons=This season had a storyline centering on the pattern of hurt that BoJack Horseman left behind in his female friends and lovers which culminated in BoJack being exposed on national television and going to jail. BoJack's relationship with women and how these women have picked up the pieces of their lives after his harm was greatly explored. For example, we see Princess Carolyn move on from being his long term lover and manager, flourishing in her work, coming into her own as an adoptive mother, and marrying her personal assistant. \n[sex01] actor shares sexuality with character=Many heterosexual actors share their sexuality with the character. It is not clear if Aaron Paul who plays the asexual Todd Chavez is also asexual, but he stated \"I was so proud to represent that community.\"\n[sex03] challenges stereotypes and tropes about queer sexuality= Todd Chavez, an openly asexual character, ends up moving in with his girlfriend Maude. Todd's asexuality is never mocked by other characters in this season which breaks tropes about queer folks always facing backlash when they come out and are openly queer. His asexuality is also not his entire character. For example, in this season we get to see Todd mend the relationship with his estranged mother and step father. many asexual folks are portrayed as cold and heartless or dehumanized, which Todd is clearly not as he is a carefree, caring character. We have many moments of Todd feeling very human such as when BoJack is writing on a whiteboard the list of his wrongs in his life. Todd secretly adds the wrongs BoJack did to him to the board so it is clear he still feels pain over those events. We see Todd struggle with anxiety over the perception of his success in life when he throws a housewarming party and invites a bunch of actors to impress his mother and step father.  \n[sex05] nuanced representation of queer sexuality=read [sex03]\n[sex13] increased visibility / investment to queer characters and/or queer relationship compared to past seasons= We get to see Todd, an asexual character, get into his first relationship with Maude. They have such a successful relationship that they move in together. Thus we get to see an asexual individual in a happy relationship which is nuanced and not shown frequently in media where asexual people are often shown as heartless and having no interest in relationships. \n[sex15] queerness normalized= Queerness is normalized through the character of Todd Chavez. Discussed in [sex03]. We get to see this queer individual living their life but their asexuality is not the only aspect of their character. \n[dis07] nuanced representation of mental health=A central theme of BoJack Horseman is the struggles of characters with their mental health. We see BoJack, Diane, and Hollyhock primarily deal with mental health issues. For example we see Diane taking psychiatric medication which she feels interferes with her ability to write about her traumatic childhood. We see Hollyhock at a party have a panic/anxiety attack and have a fellow teen work her through her nervousness via a grounding technique. Therapy is discussed as a positive thing throughout the show. Individuals with mental health struggles are not demonized for those struggles but are portrayed as relatable people, even BoJack, who in many ways could be considered irredeemable. The main message of the show is just to pick yourself up and keep trying to be better, even if you fall off the horse and fall back into destructive habits. The show also explores how childhood trauma can impact the mental health of live individuals. Finally suicide is also discussed by BoJack's hallucination of the athlete Secretariat in a harrowing poem \"The View From Halfway Down\" which was written as suicide  prevention explicitly. \n[dis19] mental health de-stigmatization=see [dis07]. Generally mental health issues are portrayed as something normal and that anyone could suffer with. \n[misc05] nuanced portrayal of body size= The character of Diane gains weight after she starts taking Prozac for depression. She does not go off Prozac due to her weight gain. Her weight gain was a signifier of positive changes in her life with her taking her medication and getting her mental health sorted. None of her friends or her boyfriend Guy commented on it. It was framed as a rather neutral thing. ",

    "negativeReceptionTagNotes": "[eth02] actor does not share ethnicity with character= The Vietnamese-American Diane is played by white actress Alison Brie.\n[eth04] reinforces stereotypes and tropes about poc/mixed-race people=The black coded Bison family of Guy and Sonny could be considered stereotypical in that Guy and Sonny's mother are divorced and that Sonny/Guy both like sports (Sonny acts very sporty and likes Lacrosse). This ties into stereotypes about Black families and athleticism. Although, Guy and his ex-wife have a somewhat amicable relationship as Guy is willing to move to Texas to be closer to his son when his ex-wife moves. \n[gen06] reinforces stereotypes and tropes about women=BoJack sometimes leans on stereotypes for its female characters. For example, Princess Carolyn is a no-nonsense business woman and Hollyhock is a young college student. The show often makes jokes surrounding these tropes even if the characters themselves are more nuanced, thus reinforcing tropes in a way. \n[dis20] mental health stigmatization= The character of BoJack who struggles with mental health is portrayed as a very toxic, dangerous individual who ruined many peoples lives, specifically women. He is a predator, manipulative, and self centered. He is shown in many ways regretting these decisions and working to be better but ultimately having such a destructive character with mental health issues (even if the depiction of them is very realistic and nuanced) can be stigmatizing. \n[int02] actor does not share intersectional identity with character= The Vietnamese-American Diane is played by white actress Alison Brie.",
