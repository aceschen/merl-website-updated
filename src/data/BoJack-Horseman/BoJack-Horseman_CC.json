She appears as a hallucination to BoJack in this season. \n\nImportance in show/Relationship to Main character BoJack Horseman: Sarah Lynn is a former child star who has known BoJack since she was a young actress. She has a rather toxic, co-dependent relationship with BoJack as they both experience addiction, self destructive behavior, and alcoholism. BoJack at one point checked Sarah Lynn into rehab, but later approached her in order to have a \"bender\" disrupting her sobriety. This resulted in the death of Sarah Lynn via heroin overdose. BoJack Horseman provided Sarah Lynn the heroin and pretends as though he was not present when Sarah Lynn died in order to cover his tracks. BoJack lies directly to the police about this and stages the scene of Sarah Lynn's death to make it look convincing. In Season 6 part 2, Paige Sinclair is investigating the mysterious death of Sarah Lynn, which leads her to BoJack. BoJack also slept with Sarah Lynn in the past despite their age difference and history.\n\nPersonality: Sarah Lynn appeared to be a childish, reckless, self-centered, self-destructive pop star. Under the surface, Sarah Lynn was suffering with alcohol and substance abuse and experienced mental health issues.   \n\nOccupation: Sarah Lynn was a former child actress on the TV show Horsin' Around with BoJack Horseman. She also worked as a famous model, singer, and was an aspiring architect. \n\nAge: Sarah Lynn was 31 years old at the time of her death in Season 3 Episode 11. We see flashbacks of Sarah Lynn at the age of 10 years old. Within BoJack's hallucination we also see Sarah Lynn age up from a child of three to her 31 year old self in the episode Season 3 Episode 15. \n\nRelatives/Relationships: Sarah Lynn's mother Carol Himmelfarb-Richardson is a selfish, controlling, abusive parent who is exploiting Sarah Lynn and her fame as a childhood actress. \n\n",
