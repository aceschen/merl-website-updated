						WandaVision isn't particularly offensive when it comes to diversity on screen, but it's not good either. Is it a fine way to spend six hours? Yes. Are the episodes better at 1.25x speed? Also yes. In the perfect fantasy suburban town of Westview, New Jersey, white women rule—as they do in reality, in most American suburbs. This show is all about Wanda Maxinoff. Unfortunately, this means BIPOC characters—like the highly praised Teyonah Parris playing Monica Rambeau (link to Forbes article), who gets transported into Wanda's world as Geraldine—are little more than accessories and tropes in Wanda's constructed world. Geraldine is a neighbor for comedic relief and to serve Wanda when convenient, such as when she goes into unexpected labor. The only other BIPOC character in the show, Jimmy Woo, also revolves around Wanda's story, though actor Randall Park brings in his own humor to brighten up otherwise dull lines. The wasted potential of these two characters is so bad, fans have been calling for a spin-off featuring them (JimmyMonica, anyone?) (link to article).
						<br/><br/>
						<spoiler>Of course, part of Monica's tepid characterization is a commentary on the sterility, predictability, and control facilitated by the suburbs—something Wanda lacks after the events of Avengers: Endgame and the loss of her husband. Yet even when Monica breaks out of Wanda's control, her character still falls into tropes of Black women serving white women, such as how Monica uses her body as a human shield for Wanda in the last (Jingyi: need to double check when) episode.</spoiler>
						<br/><br/>
						Most comic adaptations for the modern screen race-bend characters whose new ethnic identities add a layer to their narrative—take, for instance, Mark Grayson in Invincible, who feels pressure not only from failing to have superpowers like his dad, but also from wanting to be a good son in his Korean American family. WandaVision, unfortunately, does the opposite by white washing Wanda's Romani Jewish roots; the show gives us some paltry flashbacks of her and her brother running from an unspecified war. What it chooses instead to highlight is Wanda's denial of and grief for her husband's passing. On the one hand, this plays into hysterical women tropes—as pointed out by other reviewers (cite), Wanda hurts the citizens of Westview when her (female, womanly) emotions get out of control. On the other hand, the show does seem to believe genuinely that these flaws are what make Wanda stronger—yay, feminism! And, while I personally don't get it (yes, it's cool that a woman and android have babies, but isn't it just a nuclear family? Aren't we still upholding heteronormativity?), Wanda and Vision's non traditional relationship has been met with positive reception from queer fans (cite), as has how campy Agatha is. <spoiler>But doesn't that just mean we have another queer coded Disney+ villain?</spoiler>
						<br/><br/>
						The first few episodes of WandaVision are in black and white, emulating the early sitcoms of the 1950s. If I could, like Wanda, construct my own perfect world, it would be one where her story has a little more color.
